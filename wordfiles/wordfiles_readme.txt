
WHO CAN USE wordfiles.uew AS IS WITHOUT ANY MODIFICATION?
=========================================================

The file "wordfiles.uew" can be used as is if you are using

   - UE  - UltraEdit for Windows     v15.00 or any later 1)
   - UEP - UltraEdit Portable (UEm)  v15.00 or any later
   - UE3 - UltraEdit for U3 drives   v15.00 or any later 2)
   - UEX - UltraEdit for Linux       v2.2.0 or any later
   - UEM - UltraEdit for Apple MAC   v2.2.0 or any later
   - UES - UEStudio  for Windows     v9.10  or any later

AND you can see in the Syntax Highlighting configuration dialog the
path to a directory containing 1 or more *.uew files each containing
exactly 1 syntax highlighting language definition.

Extract or copy "wordfiles.uew" into the directory displayed in the Syntax
Highlighting configuration dialog and next time a *.uew file is opened, it
should be syntax highlighted with code folding for the color groups and
displaying the defined color group names in the Function List view.

You can edit the third line in "wordfiles.uew" and change it to

/Function String = "%/^(C[1-9][0-9]++"*"^)"

to see not just the name of a color group, but also the number of the
color group at beginning. That is helpful to see quickly when a color
group number is used twice by mistake within a wordfile with just a
single syntax highlighting language definition.

WHO HAVE TO MODIFY wordfiles.uew BEFORE IT CAN BE USED?
=======================================================

Versions of UltraEdit prior the versions listed above do not support
unlimited wordfiles with file extension UEW stored in a directory.

If such a version of UltraEdit is used, or in a later version there is
used still a single wordfile with multiple syntax highlighting language
definitions inside, it is necessary to first open and edit "wordfiles.uew"
before the content can be copied into the wordfile specified in the Syntax
Highlighting configuration dialog.


WHAT TO EDIT?
-------------

1. The language number /L20 at top of "wordfiles.uew".

   A wordfile with multiple syntax highlighting language definitions can
   contain only up to 20 languages. (UltraEdit for Windows prior v9.00
   support even only up to 10 languages.) Search in the currently used
   wordfile for lines starting with /L and use next free number. For
   example if the currently used wordfile contains /L1 to /L13, the
   number on first line of "wordfiles.uew" should be modified to

   /L14"IDM Wordfiles"


2. The file extension UEW at top of "wordfiles.uew".

   The file "wordfiles.uew" is defined to syntax highlight all files
   with file extension UEW in any case. But if the wordfile currently
   used by your version of UltraEdit has for example the original
   default file name "wordfile.txt", the string

   File Extensions = UEW

   at end of first line of "wordfiles.uew" must be replace by

   File Names = wordfile.txt wordfile.new wordfile.old

   to apply the syntax highlighting language "IDM Wordfiles" only to
   files with not case-sensitive name "wordfiles.txt", "wordfiles.new",
   or "wordfiles.old".

   "wordfiles.new" was created on update of UltraEdit by the installer when
   not replacing the currently used "wordfile.txt" and instead installs the
   new default wordfile as "wordfile.new" into the program files directory
   of UltraEdit. You can omit file name "wordfile.new" if you don't have
   such a file in the program files directory of UltraEdit.

   "wordfiles.old" was created as backup of currently used "wordfiles.txt"
   on update of UltraEdit by the installer in the program files directory
   of UltraEdit when replacing the currently used wordfile. If you don't
   have such a file in program files directory of UltraEdit, you can omit
   that file name on first line of "wordfiles.uew".


3. The /Function String regular expression search string on third line.

   The UltraEdit regular expression search string on third line of
   "wordfiles.uew" is designed for displaying the names of the up to
   20 color groups in the Function List view. UltraEdit prior v17.00 and
   UEStudio prior v11.00 support only up to 8 color groups and therefore
   it makes sense to adapt also this search string for the lower number
   of color groups. Further for a wordfile containing multiple syntax
   highlighting language definitions, it is very useful to get the names
   of the languages listed in the Function List view. For details on how
   to change the function string, please read also the next chapter.

After making the changes as suggested, the content of "wordfiles.uew"
can be copied and appended to currently used wordfile best opened by
opening the Syntax Highlighting configuration dialog, pressing button
Open and closing the configuration dialog with button Cancel.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THE FUNCTION LIST VIEW?

a) Modify expression for finding only up to 8 color groups.

   UltraEdit prior v17.00 and UEStudio prior v11.00 support only up
   to 8 color groups for a syntax highlighting language, but later
   versions support up to 20 color groups.

   The UltraEdit regular expression

/Function String = "%/C[1-9][0-9]++"^(*^)""

   finds lines starting with /C with a number in range 1 to 99 with a
   color group name in double quotes. But if you are using a version of
   UltraEdit supporting just up to 8 color groups or you plan to define
   a new wordfile for public usage, the regular expression search string
   on third line of "wordfiles.uew" should be changed to

/Function String = "%/C[1-8]"^(*^)""


b) List the language names in Function List view instead of the color
   group names.

   With 10 or more syntax highlighting languages within a wordfile listing
   all color group names is perhaps less useful than listing all language
   names. Therefore it could be better to replace the character C in the
   function string definition line by character L to get

/Function String = "%/L[1-9][0-9]++"^(*^)""

   which results in displaying the up to 20 language names (or just
   10 for really old versions of UltraEdit) in Function List view.


c) Get color group and language names listed in Function List view.

   Instead of listing either the color group names or the language
   names it could be also useful to list both. That is possible by
   using for example

/Function String = "%/^(C[1-8]"*"^)"
/Function String 1 = "%/L[1-9][0-9]++^("*"^)"

   The first expression without the number left the equal sign is
   for displaying the color group names for /C1"..." to /C8"..." with
   displaying also Cx and the double quotes for getting the color group
   names always displayed at bottom of the Function List view if sorting
   the strings in the view alphabetically is enabled as it is by default.

   The second expression with number 1 is for displaying the language
   names for /L1"..." to /L20"..." with displaying just the language
   names with the double quotes. That results in showing the language
   names at top of the function list view when sorted alphabetically.
   If sorting of the strings in Function List View is not enabled, or
   you want to see also the language numbers, move ^( in the regular
   expression left between / and character L.


d) Use grouped function strings for Function List view.

   UltraEdit v16.00 and UEStudio v10.00 or any later version support also
   grouped function strings with displaying the found strings in a tree
   (or optionally as flat list). When using always the flat display of
   the Function List view, the 2 function string definitions as written
   above should be used. But if the tree display is used as it is default,
   the language and color group names could be displayed in function list
   view in a tree. That can be achieved by replacing the line

/Function String = "%/C[1-9][0-9]++"^(*^)""

   in "wordfiles.uew" by the block

/TGBegin "Languages"
/TGFindStr = "%/L[1-9][0-9]++"^(*^)""
/TGBegin "Color Groups"
/TGFindStr = "/^(C[1-9][0-9]++"*"^)[~"^p]++$"
/TGFindBStart = "%/L[0-9]+"
/TGFindBEnd = "^{^p/L[0-9]+^}^{^p$^}"
/TGEnd
/TGEnd

   Please note that there must be a blank line at end of the wordfile (file
   ends with 0D 0A 0D 0A - 2 DOS line terminations) to see also the color
   group names of last language in the Function List view. And there should
   be no blank lines in entire wordfile, except between last line of a
   language definition and first line of next language definition. In some
   user contributed wordfiles there are also blank lines above color group
   definition lines for visual grouping. With using syntax highlighting
   for wordfiles those blank lines can be removed because you have now
   a much better visual help.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


WHY ARE SOME COLOR GROUPS NOT LISTED IN THE FUNCTION LIST VIEW?


The UltraEdit regular expression search strings above as well as the default
regular expression string do not find color groups without a name. Some old
user contributed wordfiles available for download on server of IDM contain
just /C1, /C2, ... without a name in double quotes.

Also some of the user contributed wordfiles have color group definitions
with wrongly defined names, for example a space between number and first
double quote, or a name without double quotes. Before using such wordfiles
you should add names for the color groups or correct the color group
definition lines with not correct syntax. The correct syntax is:

/Cx"Color Group Name"

Please send IDM your improved version of the wordfile by email with the
request to replace the existing wordfile on IDM's server with the new one.

on creating a wordfile or when you want that an expert validates it.


1) Except special German version 15.20.1.1000 SE which works only
   with one wordfile with multiple languages like UE v14.20.
2) UE3 is not developed further by IDM Computer Solutions, Inc.
   because SanDisk stopped U3 smart drives development.
